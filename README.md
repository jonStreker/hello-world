#H1 README Edit

I am an arts educator who is changing careers into the tech field. I have been building a curriculum by sorting online resources, and am currently refining my portfolio and projects. I cannot afford a bootcamp or new loans to go back to college, so I have chosen to educate myself to the best of my ability. I have networked and interviewed people in the field who are full stack devs, project managers, and hardware manufacturers. I am combining lectures, exercises, projects, and collaborative learning in order to prepare for a job as a full stack developer. Demystifying computer programming and tech has been endlessly interesting to me.
